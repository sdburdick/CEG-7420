Buffer Overflows are a critical issue for programs
both for software stability and security. Buffer Overflows within
network processing routines pose an even more critical threat
surface for attackers to discover, exploit, and compromise a
system. An automated Buffer Overflow detection capability for
network facing code would enable a layer of protection to the
application security and assurance process.

This repository contains a test application that establishes multiple methods of inter-process communication lines.  
It also contains a python script that can be executed in Ghidra to detect network connection/dangerous memory copy indicators in an application
